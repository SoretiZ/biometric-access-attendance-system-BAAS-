### Problem Statement
Manual attendance systems are inefficient and prone to manipulation. Similarly, secure areas in banks require a more foolproof access method than keys or cards.

### Planned Solution
We are building a biometric-based system that uses a fingerprint sensor to:
- Record employee attendance at offices.
- Control access to secure areas like money chambers in banks.

### Expected Outcome
- Accurate and tamper-proof attendance records.
- Real-time access logs for secure areas.
- Increased operational efficiency and security.

### Faydaâ€™s Role
We plan to integrate Fayda ID verification to:
- Confirm user identity during fingerprint registration and access.
- Synchronize attendance data with national digital identity frameworks.

### Tech Stack
- Microcontroller:  ESP32
- Biometric Module: R305 Fingerprint sensor
- Communication: UART, I2C
- Display: TFT screen
- Authentication: Fayda VeriFayda OIDC API
- Database: Firebase or SQLite (local)
- Languages: Embedded C, Python (for backend)
